# TagTango::Template

![CI workflow](https://github.com/trinistr/tag_tango-template/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

This is a template gem repository. There is nothing interesting here.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/trinistr/tag_tango-template <name>
cd <name>
bin/setup <name>
```

## Development

DO NOT RUN `bin/setup`, this initializes a new gem.

Add, remove and change files as needed.
When `bin/setup <some_name>` is ran, `template` and `Template` will be replaced
with `some_name` and `SomeName` accordingly.
